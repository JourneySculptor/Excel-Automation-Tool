│   ├── sample.xlsx      # Example Excel file (to be provided by the user)
│   ├── high_sales.xlsx  # Output file for filtered sales data
│   ├── sales_chart.png  # Generated sales graph
│   ├── sales_report.pdf # Generated PDF report
│── venv/                # Virtual environment (not included in GitHub)
│── main.py              # Main Python script
│── requirements.txt     # Dependencies file
│── README.md            # Documentation file
│── credentials.json     # Google Sheets API credentials (not included in GitHub)
```

## Requirements
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the tool:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl matplotlib fpdf gspread oauth2client
```

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JourneySculptor/Excel-Automation-Tool.git
cd Excel-Automation-Tool
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Place your Excel file in the `sample_data/` folder.
4. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
5. Follow the prompts to process the Excel file.

## Example Output
### Filtered Data:
The script extracts rows where sales exceed 10,000 and saves them in `high_sales.xlsx`.

### Generated Graph:
A bar chart showing sales by category is saved as `sales_chart.png`.

### PDF Report:
A summary report is generated as `sales_report.pdf`.

### Google Sheets Upload:
If configured correctly, the filtered data is uploaded to Google Sheets.

### Google Sheets Setup
To enable Google Sheets integration:
1. Create a **Google Cloud project** and enable the **Google Sheets API**.
2. Generate a **Service Account Key** (`credentials.json`).
3. Place `credentials.json` in the **project root directory** (`Excel-Automation-Tool/`).
4. Run the script to automatically upload data to Google Sheets.

> **Do NOT upload `credentials.json` to GitHub!** Add it to `.gitignore` to keep it secure.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement GUI for non-technical users.
- Add email automation for sending reports.
- Enhance error handling for better user experience.
